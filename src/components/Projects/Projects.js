              description="I built an Airbnb clone web application where users can register, browse properties, filter by location, price, and amenities, and securely book rentals. Hosts can add and manage listings with details such as images, availability, and pricing. The project was developed using Java with Spring Boot and Hibernate for backend services and PostgreSQL for data storage, while authentication was managed using Spring Security with JWT. On the frontend, I used JSP/Thymeleaf for dynamic rendering and ensured a responsive UI. I also implemented real-time availability checks, validation layers, and RESTful APIs for seamless client–server communication. This project enhanced my expertise in Java-based full-stack development, focusing on API integration, database design, and building scalable, user-friendly applications."

              description="Word Mastermind is an engaging word-guessing game that challenges players to deduce a hidden target word. Players enter guesses, and the game provides immediate feedback for each letter: letters in the correct position are marked green, while correctly guessed but misplaced letters are highlighted in yellow. Unmatched letters remain unmarked, helping players refine their strategy as they progress. All guesses must be valid words, adding an element of linguistic skill and vocabulary knowledge. To enhance gameplay further, the on-screen keyboard dynamically updates, visually indicating letter statuses—present (green), absent (dark gray), or unknown (light gray), ensuring an interactive and intuitive experience."
